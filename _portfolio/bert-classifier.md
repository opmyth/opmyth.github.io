## About this project:
Hey there! I've been working on a text classification project using BERT to analyze IMDB movie reviews. The goal? Teaching AI to figure out if a review is thumbs up or thumbs down. I picked this project because it's a relatable way to showcase how AI can understand human language.
It's been a great learning experience, diving into transfer learning and attention mechanisms. I've gotten my hands dirty with the Hugging Face Transformers library and the ins and outs of fine-tuning pre-trained models. It's pretty cool to see the AI actually start to understand the sentiment in text!
