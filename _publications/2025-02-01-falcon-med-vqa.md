Falcon Med-VQA is a cutting-edge visual question-answering system specifically designed for medical applications. This work represents a significant contribution to the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and healthcare technology. The system demonstrates advanced capabilities in understanding and answering questions about medical images, making it a valuable tool for healthcare professionals and medical education.

The research was conducted as part of the Computer Vision Team at Technology Innovation Institute, where extensive work was done on vision-language models (VLLMs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) applied to healthcare challenges.
